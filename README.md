## 🚀 What I Love

🤖 I'm learning about Artificial Intelligence and trying to understand it deeply — so I can build my own AI one day!  
🎮 I love creating games and bringing fun ideas to life.  
🌎 I'm also creating simulations and systems that help me grow in programming and explore the philosophy of how things work.
